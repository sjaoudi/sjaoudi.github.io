I am a software engineer with 6+ years of experience building solutions in the financial trading and healthcare industries, primarily using Microsoft technologies (C#, .NET, Azure). I recently became Microsoft Certified in Azure (AZ-900) and Security, Compliance, and Identity (SC-900). I have led the development and deployment of high-volume systems in areas such as trading systems and health insurance claims. I enjoy contributing as a technical leader and mentor while supporting diverse teams. See my [resume](/resume.pdf) for more details!

I spent the last three years on a personal pursuit of long distance hiking trails in the U.S. such as the Appalachian Trail (2023), Pacific Crest Trail (2024), and Continental Divide Trail (2025). I also frequent New Hampshire's White Mountains and am a member of the [Four Thousand Footer Club](https://www.amc4000footer.org/). In the hiking world they call me Zookeeper after I became notable for my wildlife encounters on the Appalachian Trail.

I also take pictures on film cameras ([1](/post/pct-film/), [2](/post/film)), work on a [trail crew](https://appalachiantrail.org/get-involved/volunteer/trail-crews/mid-atlantic-trail-crew/), and climb rocks.
