Here is a simple project for getting started developing emulators, as you have to write code for fetching an instruction, decode it, execute it, and work with registers, pointers, and rendering simple graphics. The CHIP-8 was actually an interpreted programming language. It was commonly run in the 70s on the RCA COSMAC VIP computer. 

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8 for a technical description of the virtual machine.
