Using a full spectrum camera enables light to be captured from outside the visible spectrum, and is most commonly used for infrared photography and astrophotography, as many deep space objects like nebulae emit gases just outside the visible spectrum. I bought an inexpensive Canon T3i DSLR from eBay to convert into full spectrum for these purposes. Some vendors offer cameras already modified for sale or can do the conversion as a service for a couple hundred dollars. See [Gary Honis](https://garyhonislegacy.com/) who has a website with DSLR photos from converted cameras and helpful DIY instructions for anyone who wants to do a conversion themselves, but please read the warning and disclaimer.

After disassembling the camera body, disconnecting most of the ribbon cables inside, unscrewing the main circuit board from the case, the imaging chip can be removed.

A full-spectrum conversion involves replacing two glass IR cut filters on the sensor with a clear glass replacement. These block IR and transmit visible light (low pass). Here’s the clear glass piece before it was installed:

In the background is one of the filters I shattered when removing it. Once the clear glass is installed, it’s now a full spectrum camera.

This was a lot less fun than I expected. Some screws inside and outside are tiny and tightened very securely. They were pretty fragile and prone to threading, which happened a few times. In one case I even had to saw off the plastic on the case to get the screw out. The imaging chip is held at a very particular location inside the camera with spring-loaded screws for accurate focusing, so the chip must be reinstalled at the exact height in the case, which was somewhere between 1 and 1.5mm. A micrometer would’ve been helpful. To accommodate the slight extra thickness of the clear glass, the mounting screws on the chip had to have an extra 1/12 rotation. With the sensor reinstalled and all the cables reattached, the camera didn’t turn on. All the connections were disconnected and reconnected 3 times with no luck. Thinking this was now a paperweight, I reinstalled the rest of the screws in camera body just to keep everything together. And then it turned on. My best guess is that the battery wasn’t seated properly with the camera not fully reassembled.

For infrared photography, an infrared filter can go on the lens to block out visible light. I’m using the Kolari Vision K720, which transmits wavelengths higher than 720nm. It appears totally black and opaque. The Canon T3i has a “live view” feature, but the viewfinder is useless here. A mirrorless camera with an electronic viewfinder might work better for infrared photography.

This is me pressing a button on my TV remote in a well-lit room. The remote itself appeared black and opaque and the light was blinking at a certain frequency.

Here are some images in daylight:

Shifting the white balance and hue/saturation can produce images in false color:

The result is cool but somewhat distorted. This would probably be more effective if another infrared filter was used such as a 665nm, since more visible light is transmitted and the colors would have more contrast. How neat it is to view the world through a different LENS…
