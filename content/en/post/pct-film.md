I carried an [Olympus XA-2](https://www.kenrockwell.com/olympus/xa.htm) with a single roll of Portra 400 on my thru-hike of the Pacific Crest Trail. The camera was compact and portable and fit nicely in the side pocket of my backpack. Despite my best efforts the camera was exposed to a wide range of elements and the film was damaged (in a sentimental way). The camera was pretty rusty after the hike and I had to perform darkroom surgery on it after the spool rewinder snapped.
